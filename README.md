# King Metric

This project presents information about the Metric System, where it came from, who is still using the Imperial System and a conversion tool, from Imperial to Metric only.

One of the purposes of this project is to demonstrate the developer skills with JS. You will be able to see this in three sections of the website:

- The converter.
- The Google Maps API, where it shows the countries still using the Imperial System, and
- The contact form, where EMailJS is used to send the messages.

_This is for educational purposes only._

## 1. UX 💻

### 1.1 Who is this website for? 👨‍👩‍

This website is for users interested in knowing a bit more about the Metric System and need to convert measurements from the Imperial System.

### 1.2 What is it that they want to achieve? 🎯

Users visit the website for different reasons. They want to:

- Learn a bit more about the history of the Metric System.
- Learn who is still officially using the Imperial System.
- Convert Imperial measurements to the Metric System.
- Get in touch with the developer behind the project.

### 1.3 How my project is the best way to help them achieve those things? 👨‍💻

The King Metric website provides all the necessary tools to convert basic Imperial measurements to the Metric System. It also provides a bit of history on the Metric System and who are the countries that to this day are still officially using the Imperial System.

#### 1.3.1 Learn a bit more about the history of the Metric System. 📚

The website provides:

- A "Origins" section in which background information is provided about the Metric System.
- Inside the website's footer, a direct link to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_the_metric_system" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> where the content for the "Origins" section was taken.

#### 1.3.2 Learn who is still officially using the Imperial System. 📚

The website provides:

- A "The Others" section in which information and a map are provided about the countries who are still officially using the Imperial System.
- Inside the website's footer, a direct link to the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-countries-use-the-imperial-system.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Webpage</a> where the content for the "The Others" section was taken.

#### 1.3.3 Convert Imperial measurements to the Metric System. 🧮

The website provides:

- A "Convert" section in which users can easily convert Imperial units to the Metric System.
- The measuring properties considered for this project are Length, Area, Volume and Weight.
- For each property, the project provides four options of units to be converted. For example, for Length, we offer Inch, Foot, Yard and Mile.
- A "Reset Converter" button is provided to clear the converter for other conversions.

#### 1.3.4 Get in touch with the developer behind the project. 📧

The website provides:

- A "Contact" section in which users can get in touch with the developer. The form asks for Name, Email and a Message.
- This is a fully operational contact form, which includes an automatic email sent to the user after submission.

### 1.4 Website Wireframes 💻📱

Below you will find the website's wireframes. These were generated using Balsamiq. There are two versions of the wireframes. Choose your option:

- Wireframes for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bCmX4HrQt4wVbTsTArFjPO-Wf3a5Vp_f/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">desktop & mobile version in PDF</a>.
- Wireframes for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfSxslhGBw88hK4E2KWCFZT2NFAwRp1U/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">desktop & mobile version in Balsamiq</a>.

### 1.5 Design Decisions 🎨 🖌

First and foremost, the essential elements that had to be in place were:

- **Responsiveness**: The website has to be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Interactivity**: The site has to provide users with interactivity and with more than just one type to demonstrate different managements of JS.
- **Simplicity**: The website has to be simple, easy to navigate, read and interact.

This project was developed to be presented as Milestone 2 for CI's Full Stack Software Development course. MS2 requires the explicit use of Javascript to provide site visitors with interactivity, so the decision was made to focus on a simple overall website, but with clear, interactive elements in it.

### 4.2 Testing Planning ✅

Details about how testing was conducted and the outcomes.

#### 4.2.1 Planning. 📑

The developer decided that testing was going to be conducted in parallel with the project development, which means that regularly, during the development of the project, the developer used Chrome DevTools to test the behaviour of the project both in desktop and mobile views.

The JS interactive elements were tested with its development, to make sure that the code was providing the expected outcomes consistently.

Testing the project in mobile devices was conducted towards the project's end, and only once all main sections were implemented and tested with CDT.

#### 4.2.2 Implementation. 🔨

As indicated above, JSFiddle and CDT were the main tools used to test the project regularly.

Here's how this looked like:

- Chrome browser was used as the primary tool.
- On one tab, Gitpod open with the project.
- On a second tab, the preview of the project, using the "python3" method inside Gitpod.
- On that second tab, CDT open to visualise and test styles, and use the console.
- On a third tab, JSFiddle to check the JS codes and snippets.

Once the project had finished, and the Github repository was live using Github pages, the project was tested with the mobile devices mentioned above.

#### 4.2.3 Results. 📊

Since the testing was ongoing, the results of it were many during that period. Most of the issues were related to code not doing what the developer wanted:

- **CSS rules not working**: CDT used to review the reasons, detect the root of the problem and apply the fix back to the CSS rules.
- **JS code not working**: Console used to review the potential reasons. Once possible solutions were detected, they were tested with the code and eventually fix the problem.

#### 4.2.4 Outcomes. 🚀

The eventual outcome of each testing was detecting issues, evaluating the reasons and finding the solutions.

Once the root of each issue is detected, then the applied solution is coded into the corresponding code, whether that's the HTML, CSS, JS or API.

**With each error detected and fixed, the developer's knowledge increased.**

You can run and view the project by following this URL: <a href="https://betahope.github.io/king-metric/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">View Project</a>.

### 5.1 Refactoring 🎛

Once all JS code was fully tested and everything was working as intended, it was time for refactoring, because the original codes were not optimal.

The following functions were refactored:

- PropertyConverter() in file propertyConvert.js.
- UnitConverter() in file unitConvert.js.
- ValueConverter() in file valueConvert.js.

The original codes were saved in a folder called "beforeRefactoring", inside assets/js. This was done to enable easy access to those versions if needed.
